# bpd_stops

This repo contains files related to [a Quarto Pub site](https://ninopierre.quarto.pub/bpd) for a project where I used R tools to predict arrest in police stops conducted by the Berkeley Police Department.

Project site URL: ninopierre.quarto.pub/bpd 

Polygon files are available as sets of zipped files.
* To read in files with polygon geometry using the `sf::st_read` function, you pass the path to the .shp file, and the .shp file must be in a directory with the related files I zipped with it.
